# Kevin's Best Marinara 
Yield: 4-5 cups of marinara sauce, depending how much you cook it down.
Prep Time: 20 minutes 
Total Time: 50 minutes
Diet Considerations: No common allergens

### Notes: 
This is one of the tastiest, most reliable marinara recipes I've come across. It has a full-bodied flavor, but also tastes very clean. This makes it suitable for all sorts of applications.
My top 3 uses are: Served as-is with high quality pasta, as a dipping sauce for fresh baked bread, and as a base for pizza.

### Ingredients:
x1 28oz. can of whole San Marzano tomatoes, certified D.O.P if possible. _It's more important to get whole tomatoes than certified D.O.P San Marzano's. However, San Marzanos are recommended for a reason!_
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
7 garlic cloves, peeled and slivered
2 small dried red chilies, or a generous pinch of red pepper flakes.
1 tsp kosher salt
1 large sprig of basil, or 1/4 tsp of dried oregano. _(Any dried Italian herb is sufficient)_

### Directions:
1. Pour tomatoes into a large bowl and crush with your hands. Add 1 cup of water to the tomato can, and slosh about to get all the tomato juices out. Reserve. _It's recommended that you wear an apron for this - crushing whole tomatos by hand can make a surprising mess._
2. In a large skillet (Do not use a deep pot) over medium heat, heat the oil. Just before it's hot, add the garlic. 
3. The garlic should bubble and sizzle happily as the oil continues to heat. Before the garlic browns, add the tomatoes, salt, whole chile or pepper flakes, and reserved tomato water. Give it a good stir.
4. Place basil sprig - stem and all - on the surface. Let it gently wilt, then submerge in sauce. (Or, add the dried herbs.) 
5. Simmer sauce until thickened and oil on surface is a deep orange, about 15-20 minutes. Taste test the sauce after 10 minutes, and adjust salt and herb amounts to taste.
6. What you use the sauce for determines how long you cook it. If you want this to be a pizza sauce, then remove it from the heat after 15 minutes. The sauce will finish cooking on the pizza. If the sauce is destined for pasta, cook for at least 20 minutes or until it gets to your desired texture. If the sauce is going to be used for dipping, cook for at least 30 minutes to get it nice and thick.

Keeps for about 7-10 days in the fridge, and 3-4 months in the freezer.
