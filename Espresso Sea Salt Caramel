# Espresso Sea Salt Caramels
Yield: 30-35 caramels
Prep Time: 2 hours 45 minutes
Total Time: 3 hours
Dietary Considerations: Vegetarian, Gluten Free

### Ingredients: 
3 Cups sugar
1/2 Cup light corn syrup
1/2 Cup water
2 Cups heavy cream 
10 Tablespoons salted Butter, cut into pieces 
4 shots fresh espresso
2 teaspoons Fleur de sel, plus extra for sprinkling
vegetable oil for brushing
Heat resistant pad or trivet

### Directions:
1.	**Prep the pan.** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, allowing enough to drape over the edges. Run a stick of butter along the sheet pan, then flatten parchment paper overtop butter, to ensure parchment stays in place. Brush the paper lightly with oil.
2.	**Boil the sugar.**  In a deep saucepan combine water, sugar, and corn syrup.  Bring to a boil over medium/medium high heat.  Boil until the mixture is a warm golden brown. Swirl the pan intermittently to prevent crystallization on the edges of the pot. DO NOT STIR.
3.	**Heat the Cream.**  While the sugar is coming to a boil, bring the cream, butter, and sea salt to a simmer in a smaller pot over medium heat.  Turn off the heat. Add espresso to pot. Set aside.
4.	**Finish the caramel.** When the sugar is done, turn off heat and slowly add the cream mixture to the sugar mixture. Mixture will boil vigorously, be cautious.  Cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, until the mixture reaches 248 degrees F (firm ball) on a candy thermometer.
5.	**Fill the pan.**  Carefully pour the caramel into the prepared pan. Place pan on heat resistant pad or trivet in refrigerator. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until firm.  
6.	**Cut the Caramel.**  When the caramel is cold, pry the sheet from the pan onto a cutting board. Cut the square in half.
7.	**Roll the Caramel.** Starting with a long side, roll the caramel up tightly into a log. If the roll is too thick, gently pull to desired thickness.  
8.	**Cut into Pieces.**  Sprinkle the rolled caramel with fleur de sel. Trim the ends and cut into pieces. It is easier to cut the caramel with an oiled knife. 
9.	**Wrap the Candies.**  Cut waxed paper into 4x5 inch pieces and wrap each caramel individually, twisting the ends.  Store in the refrigerator in an air-tight container and serve the caramels chilled (or bring out up to 15 min before serving for a softer bite).
